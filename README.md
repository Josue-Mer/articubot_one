## Autonomous Luggage Cart Robot

This is a project for an autonomous luggage cart based on ROS. It uses the project articubot_one from [Josh Newans](https://github.com/joshnewans/articubot_one/tree/c75cf3360e4574ff40aa6438c07739389ad3f8ed) as a template and expands from it to create more nodes and adjust it for the desired functionality.
